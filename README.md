# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator
A basic command-line calculator developed as my first project in Software Engineering (1st Semester). This project demonstrates fundamental programming logic, user input handling, and error validation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Error Handling:** Validates division by zero and non-numeric inputs using `try-except` blocks.
- **Clean Code:** Structured using functions for better readability.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts used:** Functions, Conditional Logic, Exception Handling.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tu-usuario/python-calculator.git](https://github.com/tu-usuario/python-calculator.git)
